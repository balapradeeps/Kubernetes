# Kubernetes

## Why Docker Alone is Less Useful for Industry Compared to Kubernetes

1. **Single Host Dependency**: 
   - Docker operates primarily on a single host, limiting its scalability and flexibility. In contrast, Kubernetes orchestrates containers across multiple hosts, enhancing resource utilization and fault tolerance.

2. **Lack of Auto-Healing**: 
   - Docker does not have built-in auto-healing capabilities. If a container goes down, it remains offline until a user manually restarts it. Kubernetes, however, can automatically detect and replace failed containers, ensuring high availability.

3. **Limited Auto-Scaling**: 
   - Docker's auto-scaling features are limited compared to Kubernetes. Kubernetes provides robust auto-scaling mechanisms, dynamically adjusting the number of running containers based on current demand to maintain performance and efficiency.

4. **Enterprise Features**:
   - Kubernetes offers a range of enterprise-level features such as advanced networking, persistent storage orchestration, secret and configuration management, and robust monitoring and logging. These features make Kubernetes a more comprehensive solution for large-scale, production-grade applications.
